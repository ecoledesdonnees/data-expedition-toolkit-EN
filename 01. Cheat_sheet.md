**THE QUESTIONS TO ASK**

- Did I correctly describe the content of the data expedition the target audience?

- Is there a way for participants to register?

**Good to know**:
Unless this is not your first event on the subject, there is a great deal of research and cleaning work to be done before the event, along with the preparation of facilitation documents. Identifying scenarios in advance, preparing group report templates and writing down a document with essential definitions and instructions help avoid headaches during and after the event.

- Which scenario can I identify in the data in advance and how difficult are they?

- Do I have a detailed schedule for the event?

- Will essential data be readily accessible during the data expedition?

- Will participants have a template to write their report during the event?

- Do I have a document with essential definitions and contextual info for the participants?

- If some datasets are improved and/or created, where will I share them?

**Good to know**:
Beyond 10 people, it’s wise to have at least two people dedicated to the facilitation. And it’s without taking communication into account: if you want to live-tweet, make photos or record, be sure to bring someone who will do just that. Juggling between facilitation and communication is not easy.

- Will I have time before the participants arrive to set up the event space?

- Can disabled people easily reach the place where the event will take place?

- Where are the toilets and emergency exits?

- Will participants be able to find the the place of the event easily?

- Will I need a microphone?

- Do I have enough markers and post-its for everybody?

- Will I have access to a projector and/or a whiteboard?

- Will there be enough electrical outlets for the attendees?

- Does the event have an hashtag or a way to follow it remotely?

**Good to know**:
A data expedition is generally a lenghty event, so remember bringing snacks and setting up breaks. Your attendees will thank you for that. 

- Is there a place to put the food?

- Can everybody see and hear the expedition guide?

- Should I make groups by theme or by skill level?

**Good to know**:
Gaining feedback is very important. If making your attendees fill a survey prove difficult, try to discuss a bit with them before they leave, asking them about what they enjoyed and what they were disappointed with. It will help you improve the next event.

- Do I have a feedback survey ready for the end of the event?

- Which are the key takeaways that I would like to share on the public report?

- Is the public report written in a way that is interesting for its audience?

- Which performance indicators should I follow to know where to improve?

- What are the positives and negatives that I can share with the team?
